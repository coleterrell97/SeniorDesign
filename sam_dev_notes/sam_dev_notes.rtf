At this point, our team has most of the components to begin prototyping the product. We have a 1080p camera as well as at least one Raspberry Pi 3. The 4K camera has come in, but Dr. Higgins is holding on to it for now. We will also likely get a Raspberry Pi 4 since it has better processing power. At this point, our team has also reviewed the starter code that Dr. Vora has written. Our next step is to get the starter code up and running (OpenCV and Flask properly installed).}
