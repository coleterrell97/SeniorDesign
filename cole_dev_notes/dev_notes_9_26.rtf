\
At this stage, we now have all of the hardware to begin the prototyping stage. We have the cameras, at least one Raspberry Pi 3 (which we will likely replace with a Pi 4), and our personal computers.\
\
Current Tasks:\
	Our group still needs to decide on some strategies for delegating the work involved in our project. \
	We need to develop a more specific schedule and more specific estimates of the size of our project; currently, our estimates are very abstract, but this will become clearer as we speak more with our customers and each other.\
\
Challenges:\
	We have yet to run into any real challenges, but our project is still in the infancy stage.\
\
Future Considerations:\
	None of my group mates nor I have ever worked with VR technology, so we will need to decide on a suitable place to learn the requisite material.\
