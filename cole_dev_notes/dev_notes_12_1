I have spent much of my working time on this project ensuring that we have the proper install of
OpenCV on a desktop running Ubuntu. This has required that we use the custom patch of OpenCV that
is provided by econsystems, the company that makes the cameras that we are using.

Originally, I was struggling to get the install to complete; with the help of our customer,
I was able to successfully install the correct patch of OpenCV. We discovered that the
econsystems patch broke Python support, so we had to use an old version of the patch.

Currently, I am working with Sam to ensure that our code works properly with the production
cameras that we will be using. This might take some slight adjustments, but should otherwise not pose
a great challenge.

I am also largely in charge of developing our coding assignment presentation. This should also not pose
a significant challenge.
