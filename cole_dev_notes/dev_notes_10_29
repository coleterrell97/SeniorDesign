It is my job to implement an API using Flask that can connect our UI to the application that manages our cameras.
I have found an interesting blog that covers Flask, JSON, and how to combine the two to make a simple API.

Current Tasks:
  I Will spend some time this afternoon building some example API calls to learn the basics of designing an API.
  Once this is done, I will need to talk with Shelby and Bryce so that we can start connecting API calls to the UI elements that exist
  on our webpage.

Challenges:
	I am inexperienced using Flask and JSON, so I will need to learn these tools from scratch.
