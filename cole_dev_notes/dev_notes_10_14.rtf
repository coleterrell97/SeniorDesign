We have now met with our customer on multiple occasions, and we have established a protocol for communicating with our customer. We have visited the clinic in which our product will be used, and this has given us much needed context that will guide our design decisions. We have also made decisions regarding the division of labor amongst our group.\
\
Current Tasks:\
	Now that we have decided on how to delegate the work within our group, it is time to begin planning how to actually implement our ideas. I am in charge of implementing a separate web server that will allow users of our product to manipulate certain qualities of the image in real time. Other members of our group will create a front-end UI that will allow the user to interact with this web server.\
\
Challenges:\
	We have yet to run into any real challenges.\
